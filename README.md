**Don't say it's _My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic_**  
…but of course it is. When I was vectoring out Princess Luna's flowing mane I was frustrated at how slow I was at placing the individual nodes and handles, so I wrote a Python extension to handle this for me based on how *I* myself did it (i.e. heuristics and estimation). Such was its utility that I went on to write a few more scripts (to be used independently of Inkscape), which have all been collected here. They are meant to be simple and fast, which means they can also be dangerous (at least to your vectors) – do watch out.

The name of this repository comes from the town of Kinross in Scotland, whose "sister" Perth happens to be the etymology behind the Australian Perth's name.

**Path format**  
The internal format Kinross uses to represent files was pretty much set in pitch (not stone) after Flevobézier. TODO
