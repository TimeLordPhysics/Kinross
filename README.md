**Don't say it's _My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic_**  
â€¦but of course it is. When I was vectoring out Princess Luna's flowing mane I was frustrated at how slow I was at placing the individual nodes and handles, so I wrote a Python extension to handle this for me based on how *I* myself did it (i.e. heuristics and estimation). Such was its utility that I went on to write a few more scripts (to be used independently of Inkscape), which have all been collected here.
